<< Preparation >>
To build, cmake and FindCuda.cmake are required.

http://www.sci.utah.edu/~abe/FindCuda.html


<< Procedure of Build >>
1. Move to ./build directory
2. ccmake ..
3. ./buildAll.sh
Several builds may be required because of the dependency of the libraries. 

Most of the makes are for the libraries. Only cudaPhysics/CMakeLists.txt is for the application. So if you change the application, modify the file and build again. 


<< Known Issues >>
UniformGrid and SlicedGrid cannot live at the same time (this may because of the duplication of the name of a function.)
